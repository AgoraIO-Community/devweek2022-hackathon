## Agora Extensions Challenge
For this challenge, we were looking for developers to build an app that uses the Agora Video SDKs with any of our current Partner Extensions to solve real world problems. 
  
### First Prize: SumDay
> I recently became a caretaker for my mother, and my sister is autistic. It can be a burden for everyone to schedule and keep track of essential daily tasks. I decided to build a dashboard app that makes it easy to see important information for the day, to be able to mark off what's done, and a simple way to communicate with a caretaker. I also needed an associated caretaker app to schedule reminders and keep tabs on what was done and not done on a day.

### Second Prize: Smart Call
> My inspiration for this are apps like clubhouse, WhatsApp calling and other audio calling apps and chat rooms. More people are using these to hold meetings on these forms of communication and there isn't a good way of taking down important things that have been said during the meeting. Thus was born the idea for smart call

### Second Prize: MeetVerse
> We all have used meeting platforms and the one thing they lack is interactivity and are far away from being realistic. We wanted to build something that will capture the attention of Gen-Z while also maintaining the ease of usage. To make the meeting more realistic we need a realistic space and emotions. So we decided to build MeetVerse !
